This particular example displays the current time and uses the Waveshare Pico RTC DS3231 (https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Pico-RTC-DS3231) to keep the time.
This example also uses Roboto-Medium font at size 64. In order to use your own font and size, you will need download the font ttf or otf that you want and convert it to a .py file using micropython-font-to-py. Go here to learn more: https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-font-to-py
